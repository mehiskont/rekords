-- Migration to safely handle UUID dependencies
-- This is an empty migration that simply confirms previous migration changes
-- We've already modified the existing migrations to remove UUID extension dependencies

-- If you get errors related to uuid-ossp when deploying to zone.ee:
-- 1. First try deploying with the migration changes we already made
-- 2. If that doesn't work, you may need to use this approach:

/*
-- Option 1: If tables don't exist yet, this approach should work:
-- Simply deploy the application and let Prisma create tables without UUID extension

-- Option 2: If tables already exist, you might need to:
-- 1. Export your data
-- 2. Drop affected tables
-- 3. Let Prisma recreate them without the extension
-- 4. Import your data back
